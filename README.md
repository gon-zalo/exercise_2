In this class project I trained a character-level neural network to generate (contemporary) Polish and Old Polish names, based on one of the Andrej Karpathy's lectures in Neural Networks (Building Makemore). The model learns patterns in the sequences of characters from a dataset of Polish names and uses this knowledge to generate new, realistic-sounding names. The repository contains some scraping code, the resulting files and code to train the Neural Network.
